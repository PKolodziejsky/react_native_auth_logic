# react_native_auth_logic
Implementation of react native authentication logic with Context API and React Hooks. </br>
Can be used with https://github.com/Peter019/social_network_nodejs_api (Connect the API to MongoDB account before using).
Some dependencies of this project (package.json) are unnecessary for authentication only, they are necessary for other components of the bigger project, that this repo is a part of.
